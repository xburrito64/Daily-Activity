/**
 * Everything of one kind, totalled across the whole vault.
 *
 * `field` is what a day calls it — `game` on a game block, `show` on an anime
 * one — and `source` is whichever of the two keeps the facts to go with it.
 * The counting is the same either way: how long, over how many days, between
 * which two of them.
 *
 * Anime carries one thing more, which is which episodes are already written
 * down somewhere. That is what lets the grid of them say where you had got
 * to without having to ask a website, and it costs nothing here — the days
 * are being read anyway.
 *
 * Reading every day for every question would be silly, and never re-reading
 * them would go stale the moment a day is written — so the answer is kept
 * until something changes it, or until it is old enough that a change made in
 * Obsidian rather than in here will have been noticed.
