/**
 * Finding a thing again.
 *
 * The question this answers is "when did I do this" — every stretch of time in
 * the vault that has something to do with a word. It reads the whole vault
 * rather than the days currently on screen, because "all the times I watched
 * One Piece" is a different question from "the times on this screen", and a
 * count that changed as you scrolled would be a lie.
 *
 * The search is a plain case-insensitive substring, the way find in any other
 * window works. No fuzziness, no ranking: you typed the name of a thing, and
 * either a block says that thing or it doesn't.
 */

/**
 * Everything about a block a search may look at, as one lowercased string.
 *
 * The tag is in there twice on purpose — under the name you see on its chip
 * and under the id the vault writes down — so "Walking w/ Coco" and
 * "walk-coco" both find the same afternoons. What was played, what was
 * watched, and whatever was written about it all count too: half of why a day
 * is worth finding again is the sentence attached to it.
 *
 * Episodes are the one thing left out. They are numbers, and a search for
 * "12" that turned up every twelfth episode of everything would bury the day
 * you were actually looking for.
