// Finding a game, and keeping its cover in the vault.
//
// Three databases, because no one of them does the whole job. RAWG knows
// about nine hundred thousand games including everything that never came to a
// PC, which makes it the right thing to search — but it has no cover art at
// all. What it has is `background_image`, which is key art or a screenshot:
// the picture across the top of a store page, not the box. Steam has the
// actual cover for every game it sells, at a fixed address worked out from
// the game's id, and wants no key to hand it over. So: RAWG finds the game,
// Steam draws it.
//
// Steam cannot draw all of them. It never sold Minecraft, and a game it does
// sell can still have no library art up yet, which is ordinary for something
// just released. SteamGridDB is people collecting the covers for both cases,
// at the size Steam uses, so it stands behind Steam rather than beside it: it
// is only ever asked once Steam has come back empty. It wants a free key, and
// without one this simply ends where it used to — a name and no picture.
//
// And Steam is asked for names as well as for pictures, because RAWG runs
// behind it. A game out this week is on Steam's own shelf the day it goes up
// and in RAWG some time after — a fortnight for one, longer for another, and
// the one you played last night is exactly the one that has not made it over
// yet. Steam's store search wants no key and answers with the app id, which
// is the one thing the cover needs anyway. It is asked beside RAWG rather
// than instead: RAWG still knows nine hundred thousand games Steam never
// sold, and what it says about a game is richer.
//
// Copying the cover into the vault is the part that matters. The folder still
// reads offline, still reads in five years, and still reads if this app is
// gone. Nothing here ever writes into a note; covers live in their own folder.
