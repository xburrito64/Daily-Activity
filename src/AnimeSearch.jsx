 * Saying what was watched: which show, which season of it, which episodes.
 *
 * Three questions, asked one after another rather than all at once, because
 * each one is only answerable once the one before it has been. AniList keeps
 * every season as a separate record, so "which season" is really a second
 * lookup and not a field — and the episodes cannot be listed until it is
 * known whose episodes they are.
 *
 * A show still going out only offers the episodes that have actually aired.
 * There is no honest way to have watched episode 12 of a show that has
 * broadcast eight, and offering it invites a mistake nothing would catch.
 *
 * The name and the numbers are the record: they are what the note in the
 * vault says, and what it will still say with none of this installed. The
 * cover is a copy kept beside the notes for the same reason.
